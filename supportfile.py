// This script is a Node.js application for conducting 5S workplace assessments and generating reports. 
// It allows users to input details about a workplace area, process images, and generate detailed
// assessments and recommendations based on the 5S methodology.
// However, the script itself does not actively "do" anything until a user runs it with specific inputs.
// Its purpose is to serve as a framework for organizing data, performing analyses, and generating outputs.
